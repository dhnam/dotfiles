# Dotfiles

My own dotfiles, for zsh (+oh-my-zsh +p10k combo) & nvim (w/ plugins)

Note that some keybinds (telescope for example) is quite arbitary.

Is subject to change.

Managed with yadm.

# Prerequirement

I didn't use bootstrap, so here's prerequirement (I believe those are all I need)

zsh / oh-my-zsh / p10k / nvim / vim-plug

After install those, pull from this repo using `yadm pull`, and head to vi (neovim), execute `:PlugInstall` to install all of those plugins.

After that, download some LSP in need using `:Mason`.

# Font

Every Nerd-patched font (/w Nerd Font 3.0+) works, but I used D2CodingNerdFontMono-Regular.

Font can be found [here](https://github.com/dhnam/d2coding-nerd-font). (Not official, but used patcher.)

Note that [Official D2Coding nerd font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/D2Coding) is ligature vertion, so it might broke `<Key>=test` into `<Key≥test`. Use at own risk.
